Quran
=====

Quran is a simple iOS universal application that displays the holy Quran created using Xcode 5 and iOS 7.

The index view displays all the sura title in the holy Quran. The detail view of each sura is displayed in the detail view. All the contents are parsed from an xml file. The app has a storage that stores the data once parsed. 

The quran text of this application is a copy of quran text that is carefully produced and highly verified by Tanzil (http://tanzil.net).
